# 🌾 Kale Farmers Market

**The First Web3 Metaverse Hub for the Kale Ecosystem**

Built for the **Stellar Composability Hackathon** - A revolutionary 3D virtual world that serves as both a prediction markets platform and an ecosystem hub for Kale projects.

## 🎯 Vision: The Kale Ecosystem Hub

Kale Farmers Market isn't just another dApp - it's a **metaverse platform** where the entire Kale ecosystem comes together. Imagine a 3D virtual world where each "stall" represents a different Kale project, creating a unified discovery and interaction experience.

### **Current Implementation: Prediction Markets**
Our flagship application leverages **KALE** and **Reflector** to create an engaging prediction markets platform:
